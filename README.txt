**README - Decentralized Drive Smart Contract**

Thank you for your interest in our Decentralized Drive Smart Contract. This contract is designed to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, leveraging the power of the Ethereum Blockchain. With this smart contract, users can upload files, view their files, and control access permissions for other individuals.


**Key Features:**

1. File Upload: Users can securely upload their files to the Decentralized Drive. The files are stored on the Ethereum Blockchain, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

2. File Access Control: Users have complete control over who can access their uploaded files. They can allow or disallow access permissions for specific individuals, ensuring privacy and security.

3. File Viewing: Users can easily view and retrieve their uploaded files from the Decentralized Drive. The files are stored in a decentralized manner, eliminating the risk of centralized server failures or data loss.


**Getting Started:**

To compile and deploy the Decentralized Drive Smart Contract, follow the steps below:

1. Install Remix IDE: Remix IDE is an online development environment that supports Solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts. Visit https://remix.ethereum.org and ensure you have the latest version.

2. Open Remix IDE: Launch Remix IDE in your web browser and create a new file for your smart contract.

3. Copy Smart Contract Code: Copy the code of the Decentralized Drive Smart Contract into the new file in Remix IDE.

4. Compile the Contract: In Remix IDE, select the appropriate Solidity compiler version, and click on the "Compile" button to compile the smart contract. Ensure that there are no compilation errors.

5. Configure Deployment Environment: In the Remix IDE, select the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab. Choose the Ethereum network you want to deploy the smart contract on, such as the local development network or a public testnet.

6. Deploy the Contract: Click on the "Deploy" button in the Remix IDE. Confirm the deployment transaction and wait for the contract to be deployed on the selected Ethereum network. Once deployed, note down the contract address.


**Usage:**

Once the smart contract is deployed, users can interact with it using a web3-enabled Ethereum wallet or a decentralized application (DApp) that integrates with the smart contract.

1. File Upload: To upload a file, call the appropriate function in the smart contract, providing the necessary parameters such as file metadata and content.

2. Access Control: Use the smart contract's access control functions to allow or disallow access permissions for specific individuals. These functions provide fine-grained control over who can view and access uploaded files.

3. File Retrieval: Retrieve files by calling the appropriate function and providing the necessary parameters. The smart contract will return the file content or metadata, depending on the function used.
